Please don't actually look at the code. I wrote this quick because I needed to download a textbook for school.

To get started cd into the folder and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal. Then run `main.py` and enjoy the program.

Remember, don't use this for any illegal reasons at all. Especially not if you are a student and on a tight budget. Big profiteering companies need your money. Don't use this for piracy at all. 100% never.
